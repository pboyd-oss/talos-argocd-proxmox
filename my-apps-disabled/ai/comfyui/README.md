# ComfyUI on Talos + ArgoCD

GPU-backed image/video generation service. Built on the
[`yanwk/comfyui-boot`](https://github.com/YanWenKun/ComfyUI-Docker) MEGAPAK
image (ComfyUI + 40-ish custom nodes + SageAttention / FlashAttention
pre-compiled for Ampere), running on the GPU worker and served behind
Gateway API.

```

- **Namespace:** `comfyui`
- **GPU:** one full RTX 3090 (Ampere, compute 8.6) via `runtimeClassName: nvidia`, `nvidia.com/gpu: 1`.
- **Priority:** `gpu-workload-preemptible` — llama-cpp preempts this when it needs the GPU back.
- **Strategy:** `Recreate` (mandatory — RWM NFS is fine for multi-attach in theory, but the app isn't safe to multi-write).

## Storage model — important

The PVC is a **static, pre-provisioned NFS PV** pointing at
`192.168.10.133:/mnt/ai-pool/comfyui` on TrueNAS (see `pvc.yaml`). It is
**not** a dynamically provisioned Longhorn volume. Implications:

- **The 250Gi PVC is just a quota/handle** — the real data lives on TrueNAS.
  Deleting + recreating the PVC (or the whole namespace) does **not** delete
  the models. The backing NFS share is persistent across cluster rebuilds.
- **Models are pre-loaded.** The NFS share already holds diffusion models
  (Z-Image-Turbo, Qwen-Image-Edit, Wan 2.2, etc.) from prior runs. New
  pods see them immediately at `/root/ComfyUI/models/…`.
- **`download-models-job.yaml` fills gaps.** The separate one-shot Job
  (`comfyui-download-models`) uses `huggingface_hub` + `HF_TOKEN` to pull
  specific model files to the same NFS share. It's idempotent — the Python
  script checks `os.path.exists(dest)` before downloading. Re-running the
  Job is safe; it only fetches what's missing.
- **The image's entrypoint also runs on first boot.** On a genuinely empty
  PVC, `yanwk/comfyui-boot`'s entrypoint clones ComfyUI, installs custom
  nodes, and downloads a small set of default models. It drops
  `/root/.download-complete` when finished and skips on subsequent boots.
  On this cluster that file already exists on NFS, so the entrypoint
  short-circuits straight to launching ComfyUI.

**If you ever need to "reset" the models:** don't delete the PVC — SSH into
TrueNAS and clean up `/mnt/ai-pool/comfyui/ComfyUI/models/` selectively,
or remove `.download-complete` to force the image's first-run path again.

### Resources

```
requests: cpu 2,  memory 8Gi,  nvidia.com/gpu 1
limits:   cpu 16, memory 80Gi, nvidia.com/gpu 1
```

RAM headroom is generous because big diffusion models hold the VAE/UNet
partially in CPU memory during swap. Don't shrink the limit without
watching for OOM on large-batch runs.

## Deployment

Normally ArgoCD applies this automatically (directory = Application).
Manual apply (dev / emergency):

```bash
kubectl apply -k my-apps/ai/comfyui/
```

The GPU-node prereqs (extensions, device plugin, runtime class) are
managed by `infrastructure/controllers/nvidia-gpu-operator/` — don't
re-apply them from here.

## Interactions with other apps

- **llama-cpp** lives on the same GPU worker. Its `gpu-workload-high`
  priority class preempts ComfyUI's `gpu-workload-preemptible` if both
  try to claim the GPU at the same time. If ComfyUI suddenly dies with
  SIGTERM during an LLM burst, that's why — it's intentional.
- **Open WebUI** uses ComfyUI for image generation:
  `COMFYUI_BASE_URL=http://comfyui-service.comfyui.svc.cluster.local:8188`.
  See `my-apps/ai/open-webui/configmap.yaml`.

## Gotchas

- **Don't delete the PVC to "clean up".** The NFS share is shared state —
  deleting the PVC drops the K8s handle but leaves the data on TrueNAS.
  Recreating the PVC remounts the same data.
- **Manager `config.ini` via `subPath`.** The mount uses `subPath:
  config.ini` because a full directory mount would hide the rest of the
  manager dir.
- **Custom nodes need chmod +x.** That's why `pre-start.sh` is copied
  into the PVC by an init container — a pure ConfigMap mount is
  read-only, and the image's entrypoint `chmod`s the file.
- **`download-models-job` is a Job with ArgoCD hooks** (`hook: Sync`,
  `hook-delete-policy: BeforeHookCreation`) — otherwise a Renovate image
  bump on the Python base would wedge ArgoCD on "Job is immutable".
- **NFS `nconnect=16`** is load-bearing for model-read throughput on the
  10GbE TrueNAS link. Don't drop it unless you're debugging NFS quirks.
