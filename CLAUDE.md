# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

> **Detailed instructions are in nested CLAUDE.md files** that load automatically based on which directory you're working in. This root file contains cross-cutting rules that apply everywhere.

## Project Overview

This is a production-grade GitOps Kubernetes cluster running on **Talos OS** with **self-managing ArgoCD**. The key differentiator is that ArgoCD manages its own configuration and automatically discovers applications through directory structure - no manual Application manifests needed.

**Tech Stack**: Talos OS + ArgoCD + Cilium (Gateway API) + Longhorn + 1Password + GPU support

**AI/LLM Backend**: This cluster uses **llama-cpp** (NOT ollama) for all local AI inference. The llama-cpp server runs at `http://llama-cpp-service.llama-cpp.svc.cluster.local:8080` with an OpenAI-compatible API at `/v1`. Primary model: **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B** (Unsloth UD-Q4_K_XL + `mmproj-BF16.gguf`) — multimodal, covers chat/coding/tool-calling and vision. **Gemma 4 26B-A4B** and **Qwen 3.5 Uncensored** are kept as additional presets. Full preset list + ctx/sampling is in `my-apps/ai/llama-cpp/configmap.yaml`. GPU topology: GPU 0 → llama-cpp, GPU 1 → ComfyUI (whole-card allocation, time-slicing disabled). Always use llama-cpp when configuring AI backends for in-cluster tools.

## Core Architecture Pattern: GitOps Self-Management

```
Manual Bootstrap → ArgoCD → Root App → ApplicationSets → Auto-discovered Apps
```

1. **Bootstrap once**: Apply ArgoCD manifests manually via `scripts/bootstrap-argocd.sh`
2. **Root app triggers**: Points ArgoCD to scan `infrastructure/controllers/argocd/apps/`
3. **ApplicationSets discover**: Four ApplicationSets scan for directories and auto-create Applications
4. **Everything else is automatic**: Add directory + `kustomization.yaml` = deployed app

**Critical Understanding**: Directory = Application
```
my-apps/ai/llama-cpp/           → ArgoCD Application "llama-cpp"
infrastructure/storage/longhorn/ → ArgoCD Application "longhorn"
monitoring/prometheus-stack/     → ArgoCD Application "prometheus-stack"
```

## Sync Wave Architecture

Applications deploy in strict order to prevent race conditions:

| Wave | Component | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **0** | Foundation | Cilium (CNI), ArgoCD, 1Password Connect, External Secrets, AppProjects |
| **1** | Storage | Longhorn, VolumeSnapshot Controller, VolSync |
| **2** | PVC Plumber | Backup existence checker (FAIL-CLOSED gate) |
| **3** | Kyverno | Policy engine (standalone App, webhooks must register before app PVCs) |
| **4** | Infrastructure AppSet | Explicit path list: cert-manager, external-dns, GPU operators, gateway |
| **4** | Database AppSet | Discovers `infrastructure/database/*/*` — `selfHeal: false` for DR |
| **5** | Monitoring AppSet | Discovers `monitoring/*` |
| **6** | My-Apps AppSet | Discovers `my-apps/*/*` |

**FAIL-CLOSED**: If PVC Plumber is down, Kyverno denies backup-labeled PVC creation. Apps retry via ArgoCD backoff. This prevents data loss during disaster recovery.

**Kyverno** is a standalone Application (not in an AppSet) to guarantee webhooks register before app PVCs. ApplicationSets are considered "healthy" immediately on creation.

**Databases** use a separate AppSet with `selfHeal: false` so `skip-reconcile` annotations stick during DR recovery. The infrastructure AppSet uses `selfHeal: true` which would strip manual annotations.

## Secret Management Flow

```
1Password Vault (homelab-prod) → 1Password Connect API → ClusterSecretStore → ExternalSecret → K8s Secret → Pod
```

**Never commit secrets to Git**. Always use ExternalSecret resources pointing to 1Password.

## Critical Rules

### DO:
- Use directory structure for application discovery (no manual Application resources)
- Name Service ports for HTTPRoute compatibility (`name: http`) — **fails silently without this**
- Use Gateway API (not Ingress) — this cluster uses Gateway API exclusively
- On **external** HTTPRoutes: add `labels: external-dns: "true"`, annotation `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/target: tuxgrid.com`, and `sectionName: https` on the parentRef — **all three are required or DNS/routing silently fails**
- Follow GitOps workflow for all changes
- Store secrets in 1Password, reference via ExternalSecret
- Add `backup: "hourly"` or `backup: "daily"` labels to critical PVCs for automatic Kyverno backup
- Use `storageClassName: longhorn` for PVCs that need backups (volumesnapshot required)
- Use NFS CSI driver (`csi: driver: nfs.csi.k8s.io`) for static NFS PVs — **legacy `nfs:` silently ignores mountOptions**
- Add new infrastructure component paths to `infrastructure-appset.yaml` explicitly (not glob-discovered)
- List ALL YAML files in each directory's `kustomization.yaml` under `resources:` — **unlisted files are never deployed**
- Use llama-cpp (not ollama) for in-cluster AI backends
- Use sync waves when adding infrastructure components
- Add ArgoCD hook annotations to all Kubernetes Jobs — `argocd.argoproj.io/hook: Sync` + `argocd.argoproj.io/hook-delete-policy: BeforeHookCreation`. K8s Jobs are immutable after creation; without these, image tag bumps from Renovate cause "field is immutable" sync failures. For standalone Jobs, add annotations directly. For Helm-rendered Jobs, use Kustomize patches targeting `kind: Job`
- Check `helm show values <chart> | grep -A20 certManager` when adding any Helm chart with webhooks — if a `certManager.enabled` option exists, **set it to `true`**. Helm hook Jobs for webhook certs break under ArgoCD (SA deleted before Job runs = stuck forever = API server death)
- Verify Kyverno generated backup resources after creating PVCs with backup labels
- Use `strategy: type: Recreate` on Deployments with RWO PVCs — **RollingUpdate causes Multi-Attach deadlock**

### DON'T:
- Create manual ArgoCD `Application` resources (use directory discovery)
- Use `kubectl edit` on Talos nodes (changes are ephemeral)
- Create Services without named ports when using HTTPRoute
- Mix Ingress and Gateway API
- Commit secrets to Git
- Bypass GitOps workflow for configuration changes
- Deploy without considering sync wave order
- Add Kyverno backup labels to CNPG database PVCs (they use Barman to S3, not Kyverno/VolSync)
- Add backup labels to system namespace PVCs (kube-system, volsync-system, kyverno)
- Manually create or delete ReplicationSource/ReplicationDestination (Kyverno manages these)
- Use legacy `nfs:` block for NFS PVs (mountOptions silently ignored — use CSI)
- Use `RollingUpdate` strategy on Deployments with RWO PVCs (causes Multi-Attach deadlock)
- Use `background: true` on Kyverno generate policies — **causes API server overload from continuous background scanning; use `background: false`**
- Use `mutateExistingOnPolicyUpdate: true` on Kyverno generate policies — **re-evaluates ALL matching resources cluster-wide on any policy change**
- Use `synchronize: true` on Kyverno generate policies — **drift watchers create UpdateRequests on every controller status update, hammering the API server; use `synchronize: false`**
- Omit Kyverno canonical defaults (`emitWarning`, `validationFailureAction`, `skipBackgroundRequests`) from policy YAML — **Kyverno webhook adds them, ArgoCD detects the diff, app shows OutOfSync**
- Create external HTTPRoutes without the three required pieces: `external-dns: "true"` label, `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/target: tuxgrid.com` annotation, and `sectionName: https` — **DNS won't be created and Cloudflare tunnel routing fails silently**
- Use `Replace=true,Force=true` sync-options on Jobs — causes duplicate Job execution bug ([#24005](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/24005)); use ArgoCD hooks instead
- Auto-merge major Helm chart version bumps for critical infrastructure (kube-prometheus-stack, longhorn, kyverno, cilium) — **a kube-prometheus-stack v82→v83 auto-merge caused a full cluster outage on 2026-04-08 via Kyverno webhook deadlock**. Pin Renovate to minor/patch only for these charts.
- Remove infrastructure namespaces from Kyverno webhook exclusions in `values.yaml` — **longhorn-system, argocd, volsync-system, etc. MUST be excluded or a Kyverno crash causes full cluster deadlock**. See `infrastructure/controllers/kyverno/CLAUDE.md` for details.
